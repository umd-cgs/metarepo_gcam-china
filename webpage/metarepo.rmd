# Overview
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

This documentation describes GCAM-China v7, which is developed based on the core Global Change Analysis Model version 7.1 (GCAM v7.1). GCAM is a multisector model developed and maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI, 2023). Both GCAM and GCAM-China are open-source community models. The documentation of the core GCAM is available at the GCAM documentation page 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/"> jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/</a>
, and this GCAM-China manual serves as supplementary documentation of the distinctions of GCAM-China from the core GCAM. GCAM includes representations of: economy, energy, agriculture, and water supply in 32 geopolitical regions across the globe; their GHG and air pollutant emissions and global GHG concentrations, radiative forcing, and temperature change; and the associated land allocation, water use, and agriculture production across 384 land sub-regions and 235 water basins.

GCAM-China is a China-focused version of GCAM that disaggregates the energy-economic system of the China region into 31 province-level sub-regions and six electricity grid regions that are also embedded in the global GCAM model. Electricity generation and end-use energy demand (buildings, transportation, and industry) are modeled at the provincial level in GCAM-China, and the model allows for electricity trade within grid regions. Renewable energy resources (hydro, solar, and wind) and carbon storage resources are also provincial-specific. Primary production of fossil resources including oil, gas, and coal, as well as other energy transformation sectors (hydrogen, gas, and refined liquids production) are still modeled at the aggregate national level. Agricultural and land use activities, including the supply of biomass energy feedstocks (residues and dedicated energy crops) are modeled at the level of 12 water basins in China.

Updates from GCAM-China v6:

- Harmonized with core GCAM v7.1 features
- Distinguished income groups in residential building sector
- Added provincial CH4 and N2O emissions in energy end-use sectors
- Added provincial biomass markets
- Added provincial wind and solar resource curves

GCAM-China is jointly developed and maintained by the Center for Global Sustainability at University of Maryland; the College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at Peking University; the Institute of Carbon Neutrality at Peking University; the Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University; and the Institute for Carbon Neutrality, Tsinghua University.

# Get Started
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

<span style="font-size: larger;">GCAM-China repository: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/umd-cgs/gcam-china">github.com/umd-cgs/gcam-china</a> </span>


For a quick start, download a zipped version of the latest release from
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/umd-cgs/gcam-china/releases">umd-cgs/gcam-china/releases</a>
 for either PC or Mac and the prerequisite software. Then double click on the run-gcam executable file (run-gcam.bat for Windows / run-gcam.command for Mac) within the exe folder. This will run GCAM-China using the configuration.xml which is a copy of configuration_china.xml. Once the input files have been read into the model and the model has run through all the timesteps it will output a database to the output/database_basexdb folder. 

The results in this database can be accessed and queried using the model interface which is opened using the run-model-interface executable file (run-model-interface.bat for Windows / ModelInterface.app for Mac) within the ModelInterface folder. For analyzing the results, keep in mind that there is a ‘GCAM China’ section to the Main_queries.xml file, which is used by the model interface. This section contains primary energy, electricity, refined liquids, and aggregated final energy queries which should be used instead of the corresponding queries in the standard section (‘energy’). Additionally, in order to get results for China as a whole, select all of the provinces as well as the ‘China’ region when running a query. 

For more detailed instructions for running the model and accessing the results see the core GCAM user guide:
